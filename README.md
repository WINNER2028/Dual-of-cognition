 # The process of creating the "Dual of Cognition" memory game using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML:

1. **Game Structure and Setup**:
   - Create an HTML file for the game layout.
   - Set up the grid layout for the game board where the cards will be displayed.
   - Link the CSS stylesheet and JavaScript file to your HTML file.

2. **Styling the Game Interface**:
   - Use CSS to style the game board, cards, and any additional elements.
   - Design card faces and backs, ensuring that each card face has a matching pair.

3. **Writing JavaScript Code**:
   - Define variables to store game state, such as the number of pairs, flipped cards, and matched pairs.
   - Write functions to:
     - Generate a deck of cards with matching pairs randomly shuffled.
     - Render the cards on the game board.
     - Handle card flipping when clicked.
     - Check for matching pairs and update game state accordingly.
     - Implement a timer and score counter.
     - End the game when all pairs are matched or when time runs out.

4. **Implementing Game Logic**:
   - Use event listeners to handle user interactions such as clicking on cards.
   - Implement game logic to flip cards, check for matches, and update the game state accordingly.
   - Add logic to track player score and display it on the interface.

5. **Testing and Debugging**:
   - Test the game thoroughly to ensure that it functions correctly.
   - Debug any issues or errors that arise during testing.
   - Make adjustments to improve game performance and usability based on testing feedback.
